# Rebuttal Electron App

Install this repository and run `yarn client -- --url=https://127.0.0.1:9000/ipc` in the root. Naturally change the url to point to a running IPC URI on a server


## Customisation

### Themes

Rebuttal comes with 3 themes by default and allows extras. To create a theme called `example` you need to create `public/css/example.css` and `public/img/example/...`

SCSS sections are used to our own themes but not required of any new themes

## Installation
insert instructions here

## Using


### Sending images in text chat


#### Mouse & Keyboard

When viewing a text room Drag-and-Drop the image over the app. A preview should appear above the text input box. To cancel the upload press the red 'x'

#### Touch screens

Honestly I have no idea.
